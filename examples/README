To load the examples you must first put them in the projects directory which
resides in your DATADIR (e.g. ~/.config/spring/games/projects/ on linux).

The projects can then be loaded by opening them via the "Open Project
(Ctrl-O)" action inside the game while using the correct map, or using the
startup scripts provided with the examples.

The startup scripts can be loaded by passing them as argument when running
spring, e.g. spring $PWD/script.txt or spring $PWD/script-dev.txt. The
script.txt will start the scenario in play mode, while script-dev.txt will
start it in a development mode.
